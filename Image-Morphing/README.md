# Image Morphing via triangulation
A morph is a warp of the image shape and a cross-dissolve of the image colors. The warp is controlled by defining a correspondence between the two pictures. The correspondence maps eyes to eyes, mouth to mouth, chin to chin, ears to ears, etc., to get the smoothest transformation.
